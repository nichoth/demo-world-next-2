------------------------------

## folders
Next.js has a file-based routing system where each page automatically becomes a route based on its file name. For example, a page at pages/profile will be located at /profile, and pages/index.js at /.

In a Next.js app, `pages` is one of the Next-specific folders you get.

* Pages are React components. Each file in it is a page and each page is a React component.
